### Hi there üëã
  
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science but computing is not my current profession, I work for 20+ years on R&D in the [Semiconductor Industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry). On my spare time, I like to acquire knowledge through online courses and work on my personal side projects, which I share here. My current interests are **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision** and [**Android Apps Development**](https://mohb.dev).

My hobbies are [**photography**](https://haraldoalbergaria.photos) and [**travelling**](https://nos2viajando.net/solo) and I love to combine both on my vacations. When at home, I like to watch movies and TV shows (I‚ù§Ô∏è[Star Trek](https://intl.startrek.com/shows)!).

To know a little more about my professional life and my learning achievements, please visit [**my personal website**](https://haraldofilho.github.io). I hope you enjoy what you see here, and in case any of my codes be helpful to you, please <a href="mailto:haraldo@mohb.dev">send me a message</a>, I would really like to know!

And that's it.

üññ Live long and prosper!
